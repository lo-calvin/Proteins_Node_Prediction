# Description
This project implements a DeeperGCN model for training and benchmarking on the Protein-Protein Interaction network from Open Graph Benchmark.

# Instructions
The train.ipynb notebook contains the script used for training the model and model evaluation. If you want to train the model from scratch, run all blocks except for the last one. If you want to load the model with pre-trained weights for evaluation, run all blocks except those under the "Training" section.
